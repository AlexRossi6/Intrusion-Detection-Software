## Description

The alghorithm used is based on the tree search , more precisely the minmax. We have decided to give importance to the heuristic function rather than exploring the whole depth of the tree. Using the heuristic implemented we have obtained a good player just by exploring the tree to level 2 depth, our player was fast and efficient. We did not have any time left to code the more deeply exploration of the tree, yet our player still behave quite accurately and good.
